            üìñ Wallet
        You can connect your wallet in two ways to start trading.
        1. Bind an existing wallet by importing the private key.
        2. Create a new wallet using Duck Sniper Bot.
        Two important notes:
        ‚õîÔ∏è Do not import your main wallet or wallets with significant assets.
        ‚õîÔ∏è Do not expose your private key.
        
        üìñ Managing Wallets
        Duck Sniper Bot supports binding up to 10 wallets.
        You can switch the default wallet, set wallet nicknames, etc.
        
        üìñ Auto Sniping
        Duck Sniper Bot supports opening sniping for Raydium pools. Simply send the contract address to set the sniping amount and anti-sniping mode. The bot will immediately initiate a purchase when the project launches. In settings, you can adjust the sniping fee to increase speed; it's recommended to set it above 0.01 SOL for lower failure rates and faster speeds.
        
        üìñ Pump Token Trading
        pump.fun is a fast token issuance platform on Solana. New projects, before completing the bonding curve, will not add liquidity to Raydium pools in the short term.
        If you want to trade pump tokens, simply send the contract or pump link to Duck Sniper Bot to choose whether to buy or sell.
        
        üìñ Buy/Sell
        When you need to buy or sell a specific project, directly enter the contract address, and the system will automatically recognize project information, including project data, community groups, security details, etc., to help you quickly make a trading decision.
        You can choose either anti-sniping mode or fast mode for transactions. Anti-sniping mode is safer and avoids potential losses.
        
        üìñ Quick Buy/Sell
        Click on the buy/sell amount, and the system will automatically complete the buy/sell. If the default amount does not meet your needs, click the last option "Buy x SOL/Sell x%" to enter a custom amount.
        
        üìñ Limit Orders
        Duck Sniper Bot supports placing limit orders, making it easy to buy at the bottom or take profits/losses without monitoring the market.
        You can place an order at a specified price or by a percentage change. When the token price reaches the order price, the trade is triggered immediately.
        Send the contract address, click the "Limit Order" button to start setting, and input the target price (percentage change) and automatic buy/sell amount, separated by commas. For example, enter 0.1,1 to buy 1 SOL when the price reaches $0.1. The system will automatically trigger when the price is reached.
        
        üìñ Transaction Execution
        After buying/selling, the system will usually initiate authorization automatically to reduce waiting time.
        When the transaction is successful, a success prompt will appear, indicating that the transaction has been recorded on the blockchain. You can view the actual transaction amount, token quantity purchased, transaction price, and wallet balance.
        
        üìñ Iceberg Strategy
        The iceberg strategy is a method of splitting large orders into multiple smaller orders. When making large transactions, users can use this strategy to automatically split big trades into smaller ones to avoid malicious attacks by sniping bots (gas fees will increase with the number of smaller orders).
        
        üìñ View Holdings
        Supports viewing current holdings, token names, holding value, price changes, and holding duration.
        
        üìñ Invite Rewards
        The invite reward feature allows you to copy the invite link and share it with new users. You can earn 40% of their trading fees permanently (withdrawable after reaching 0.01 SOL).
        
        üìñ Settings
        The default settings meet the needs of new traders without the need for adjustment. The recommended trading parameters have a high success rate, fast blockchain speeds, and a low risk of being sniped. Users can refer to these settings. If the token being traded fluctuates significantly or if you want to increase the speed of transactions, you can adjust the slippage and gas settings.
